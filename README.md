# DBasic
Hi !
Welcome to my bigest project so far, the DBasic programming language !
This compiler produces object code for windows x86, 32 or 64 bits, and has been tested on UNOWHY and ASUS machines.
Upon running the compiler for the first time, your computer might tell you that it presents a security risk, because it's a VBScript file downloaded from the internet, even though it's harmless
The documentation of the language can be found in the DOCUMENTATION.TXT
