# DBasic
Hi !
Welcome to my bigest project so far, the DBasic programming language !
The DBasic compiler along with the documentation can be found in the .zip file above. The object code is produced for windows x86, 32 or 64 bits, and has been tested on UNOWHY and ASUS machines.
Upon running the compiler, your computer might tell you that it presents a security risk, because it's a VBScript file downloaded from the internet
I promise you it's harmless, you can read the code if you do not trust me.
